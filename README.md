Predicting bad loans using data from LendingClub 2007-2013

Cleaning and manipulating data for making prediction models on training set and test set.
Firsly, we start with cleaning up the data in the following categories
  1. format (remove top lines that are not part the data)
  2. change data types from strings to numerical values
  3. remove columns with mostly NA values
Secondly, we apply machine learning methods on the training set of the data
Thirdly, we apply machine learning methods on the test set of the data

We can improve our accuracy by the following methods
  1. we can use other types of machine learning methods (nonlinear machine learning methods, random forest, etc)
  2. feature engineering
  3. ensembling
  4. creative ensembling (crosscat)
